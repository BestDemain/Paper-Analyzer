  "第1章 Introduction": "[章节内容长度: 2972字符。Introduction\nDeep generative models of all kinds have recently exhibited high quality samples in a wide variety\nof data modalities. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), autoregressive models, ﬂows, and\nvariational autoencoders (VAEs) have synthesized striking image and audio samples [14,{v1},{v2},\n58,{v3},{v4},{v5},{v6},{v7},{v8},{v9},{v10},{v11}], and there have been remarkable advances in energy-based\nmodeling and score matching that have produced images comparable to those of GANs [11, 55].\nFigure 1:{v12}\n34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.\narXiv:2006.11239v2  [cs.LG]  16 Dec 2020\n\n\n{v13}\n{v14}\n{v15}\n{v16}\n{v17}1{v18}0\n{v19}({v20}1{v21})\n{v22}({v23}1)\nFigure 2:{v24}\nThis paper presents progress in diffusion probabilistic models [53]. A diffusion probabilistic model\n(which we will call a “diffusion model” for brevity) is a parameterized Markov chain trained using\nvariational inference to produce samples matching the data after ﬁnite time. Transitions of this chain\nare learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the\ndata in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed. When the diffusion consists of\nsmall amounts of Gaussian noise, it is sufﬁcient to set the sampling chain transitions to conditional\nGaussians too, allowing for a particularly simple neural network parameterization.\nDiffusion models are straightforward to deﬁne and efﬁcient to train, but to the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no demonstration that they are capable of generating high quality samples. We\nshow that diffusion models actually are capable of generating high quality samples, sometimes\nbetter than the published results on other types of generative models (Section 4). In addition, we\nshow that a certain parameterization of diffusion models reveals an equivalence with denoising\nscore matching over multiple noise levels during training and with annealed Langevin dynamics\nduring sampling (Section 3.2) [55,{v25}]. We obtained our best sample quality results using this\nparameterization (Section 4.2), so we consider this equivalence to be one of our primary contributions.\nDespite their sample quality, our models do not have competitive log likelihoods compared to other\nlikelihood-based models (our models do, however, have log likelihoods better than the large estimates\nannealed importance sampling has been reported to produce for energy based models and score\nmatching [11,{v26}]). We ﬁnd that the majority of our models’ lossless codelengths are consumed\nto describe imperceptible image details (Section 4.3). We present a more reﬁned analysis of this\nphenomenon in the language of lossy compression, and we show that the sampling procedure of\ndiffusion models is a type of progressive decoding that resembles autoregressive decoding along a bit\nordering that vastly generalizes what is normally possible with autoregressive models.]",

One must choose the variances{v196}\nforward process and the model architecture and Gaussian distribution parameterization of the reverse\nprocess. To guide our choices, we establish a new explicit connection between diffusion models\nand denoising score matching (Section 3.2) that leads to a simpliﬁed, weighted variational bound\nobjective for diffusion models (Section 3.4). Ultimately, our model design is justiﬁed by simplicity\nand empirical results (Section 4). Our discussion is categorized by the terms of Eq. (5).\n3.1\nForward process and{v197}\nWe ignore the fact that the forward process variances{v198}\ninstead ﬁx them to constants (see Section 4 for details).

With{v228}({v229}1{v230}({v231}1;{v232}({v233}){v234}2\n{v235}), we can write:\n{v236}1{v237}\n{v238}\n2{v239}2\n{v240}\n{v241}({v242}0){v243}({v244}){v245}2\n{v246}\n{v247}\n(8)\nwhere{v248}.

The complete sampling\nprocedure, Algorithm 2, resembles Langevin dynamics with{v395}\ndensity. Furthermore, with the parameterization (11), Eq.

As Eq. (12)\nis equal to (one term of) the variational bound for the Langevin-like reverse process (11), we see\nthat optimizing an objective resembling denoising score matching is equivalent to using variational\ninference to ﬁt the ﬁnite-time marginal of a sampling chain resembling Langevin dynamics.\nTo summarize, we can train the reverse process mean function approximator{v412}, or by\nmodifying its parameterization, we can train it to predict{v413}. (There is also the possibility of predicting\n{v414}0, but we found this to lead to worse sample quality early in our experiments.) We have shown that\nthe{v415}-prediction parameterization both resembles Langevin dynamics and simpliﬁes the diffusion\nmodel’s variational bound to an objective that resembles denoising score matching. Nonetheless,\nit is just another parameterization of{v416}({v417}1{v418}), so we verify its effectiveness in Section 4 in an\nablation where we compare predicting{v419}.\n3.3\nData scaling, reverse process decoder, and{v420}0\nWe assume that image data consists of integers in{v421}0{v422}1{v423}.

To obtain discrete log likelihoods, we set the last term of the reverse\nprocess to an independent discrete decoder derived from the Gaussian{v426}({v427}0;{v428}({v429}1{v430}2\n1{v431}):\n{v432}({v433}0{v434}1{v435}\n{v436}\n{v437}\n{v438}\n{v439}({v440}\n0)\n{v441}({v442}\n0)\n{v443}({v444};{v445}\n{v446}({v447}1{v448}2\n1){v449}\n{v450}({v451}\n{v452}\nif{v453}\n{v454}\n1\n255\nif{v455}\n{v456}({v457}\n{v458}\nif{v459}1\n{v460}\n1\n255\nif{v461}1\n(13)\nwhere{v462}\n(It would be straightforward to instead incorporate a more powerful decoder like a conditional\nautoregressive model, but we leave that to future work.) Similar to the discretized continuous\ndistributions used in VAE decoders and autoregressive models [34,{v463}], our choice here ensures that\nthe variational bound is a lossless codelength of discrete data, without need of adding noise to the\ndata or incorporating the Jacobian of the scaling operation into the log likelihood.

The gap between train and test is at\nmost 0.03 bits per dimension, which is comparable to the gaps reported with other likelihood-based\nmodels and indicates that our diffusion model is not overﬁtting (see Appendix D for nearest neighbor\nvisualizations). Still, while our lossless codelengths are better than the large estimates reported for\nenergy based models and score matching using annealed importance sampling [11], they are not\ncompetitive with other types of likelihood-based generative models [7].\nSince our samples are nonetheless of high quality, we conclude that diffusion models have an inductive\nbias that makes them excellent lossy compressors.

Diffusion models, however, admit straightforward\nlog likelihood evaluation, and the training procedure explicitly trains the Langevin dynamics sampler\nusing variational inference (see Appendix C for details). The connection also has the reverse\nimplication that a certain weighted form of denoising score matching is the same as variational\ninference to train a Langevin-like sampler. Other methods for learning transition operators of Markov\nchains include infusion training [2], variational walkback [15], generative stochastic networks [1],\nand others [50, 54, 36, 42, 35, 65].\nBy the known connection between score matching and energy-based modeling, our work could have\nimplications for other recent work on energy-based models [67–69,{v772},{v773},{v774},{v775},{v776},{v777},{v778}].

  "第7章 Conclusion": "[章节内容长度: 2617字符。We have presented high quality image samples using diffusion models, and we have found connections\namong diffusion models and variational inference for training Markov chains, denoising score\nmatching and annealed Langevin dynamics (and energy-based models by extension), autoregressive\nmodels, and progressive lossy compression. Since diffusion models seem to have excellent inductive\nbiases for image data, we look forward to investigating their utility in other data modalities and as\ncomponents in other types of generative models and machine learning systems.\nBroader Impact\nOur work on diffusion models takes on a similar scope as existing work on other types of deep\ngenerative models, such as efforts to improve the sample quality of GANs, ﬂows, autoregressive\nmodels, and so forth. Our paper represents progress in making diffusion models a generally useful\ntool in this family of techniques, so it may serve to amplify any impacts that generative models have\nhad (and will have) on the broader world.\nUnfortunately, there are numerous well-known malicious uses of generative models. Sample gen-\neration techniques can be employed to produce fake images and videos of high proﬁle ﬁgures for\npolitical purposes. While fake images were manually created long before software tools were avail-\nable, generative models such as ours make the process easier. Fortunately, CNN-generated images\ncurrently have subtle ﬂaws that allow detection [62], but improvements in generative models may\nmake this more difﬁcult. Generative models also reﬂect the biases in the datasets on which they\nare trained. As many large datasets are collected from the internet by automated systems, it can be\ndifﬁcult to remove these biases, especially when the images are unlabeled. If samples from generative\nmodels trained on these datasets proliferate throughout the internet, then these biases will only be\nreinforced further.\nOn the other hand, diffusion models may be useful for data compression, which, as data becomes\nhigher resolution and as global internet trafﬁc increases, might be crucial to ensure accessibility of\nthe internet to wide audiences. Our work might contribute to representation learning on unlabeled\nraw data for a large range of downstream tasks, from image classiﬁcation to reinforcement learning,\nand diffusion models might also become viable for creative uses in art, photography, and music.\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\nThis work was supported by ONR PECASE and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship under grant\nnumber DGE-1752814.

The larger LSUN Bedroom model was trained for 1.15M steps.\nApart from an initial choice of hyperparameters early on to make network size ﬁt within memory\nconstraints, we performed the majority of our hyperparameter search to optimize for CIFAR10 sample\nquality, then transferred the resulting settings over to the other datasets:\n•{v1133}\nconstrained so that{v1134}0. We set{v1135}\nschedule from{v1136}1{v1137}4 to{v1138}02.\n•{v1139}1{v1140}0{v1141}1{v1142}2{v1143}3{v1144}4{v1145}.\nWithout dropout on CIFAR10, we obtained poorer samples reminiscent of the overﬁtting\n{v1146}52]. We set dropout rate on the other datasets to\nzero without sweeping.\n•{v1147}\nand without ﬂips, and found ﬂips to improve sample quality slightly. We also used random\nhorizontal ﬂips for all other datasets except LSUN Bedroom.\n•{v1148}31] and RMSProp early on in our experimentation process and chose the\nformer. We left the hyperparameters to their standard values. We set the learning rate to\n2{v1149}4 without any sweeping, and we lowered it to{v1150}5 for the{v1151}\nwhich seemed unstable to train with the larger learning rate.\n14\n\n\n•{v1152}\nthese values.\n•{v1153}\nthis value.\nFinal experiments were trained once and evaluated throughout training for sample quality. Sample\nquality scores and log likelihood are reported on the minimum FID value over the course of training.\nOn CIFAR10, we calculated Inception and FID scores on 50000 samples using the original code\nfrom the OpenAI [51] and TTUR [21] repositories, respectively. On LSUN, we calculated FID\nscores on 50000 samples using code from the StyleGAN2 [30] repository. CIFAR10 and CelebA-HQ\nwere loaded as provided by TensorFlow Datasets (https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets),\nand LSUN was prepared using code from StyleGAN. Dataset splits (or lack thereof) are standard\nfrom the papers that introduced their usage in a generative modeling context. All details can be found\nin the source code release.\nC\nDiscussion on related work\nOur model architecture, forward process deﬁnition, and prior differ from NCSN [55,{v1154}] in subtle but\nimportant ways that improve sample quality, and, notably, we directly train our sampler as a latent\nvariable model rather than adding it after training post-hoc. In greater detail:\n1.{v1155}\ncondition all layers on{v1156}\nthan only in normalization layers (NCSNv1) or only at the output (v2).\n2.{v1157}1{v1158}\nso that variance does not grow when adding noise, thus providing consistently scaled inputs\nto the neural net reverse process. NCSN omits this scaling factor.\n3.{v1159}KL({v1160}({v1161}0){v1162}({v1163})){v1164}0), ensur-\ning a close match between the prior and aggregate posterior of{v1165}\n{v1166}\nwith conditional Gaussians. Both of these factors prevent distribution shift when sampling.\n4.{v1167}\norously from{v1168}\nsampler to match the data distribution after{v1169}\nmodel using variational inference. In contrast, NCSN’s sampler coefﬁcients are set by hand\npost-hoc, and their training procedure is not guaranteed to directly optimize a quality metric\nof their sampler.\nD\nSamples\nAdditional samples\nFigure 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, and 19 show uncurated samples from the diffusion\nmodels trained on CelebA-HQ, CIFAR10 and LSUN datasets.\nLatent structure and reverse process stochasticity\nDuring sampling, both the prior{v1170}\n{v1171}({v1172}){v1173}\nof noise, we sampled multiple images conditioned on the same intermediate latent for the CelebA\n256{v1174}0{v1175}({v1176}0{v1177}){v1178}\nshare the latent{v1179}1000{v1180}. To accomplish this, we run a single reverse chain\nfrom an initial draw from the prior. At the intermediate timesteps, the chain is split to sample multiple\nimages. When the chain is split after the prior draw at{v1181}, the samples differ signiﬁcantly.\nHowever, when the chain is split after more steps, samples share high-level attributes like gender,\nhair color, eyewear, saturation, pose and facial expression. This indicates that intermediate latents\nlike{v1182}750{v1183}\nCoarse-to-ﬁne interpolation\nFigure 9 shows interpolations between a pair of source CelebA\n256{v1184}\nIncreasing the number of diffusion steps destroys more structure in the source images, which the\n15\n\n\nmodel completes during the reverse process. This allows us to interpolate at both ﬁne granularities\nand coarse granularities. In the limiting case of{v1185}\nimages in pixel space. On the other hand, after{v1186}\ninterpolations are novel samples.\nSource Rec.{v1187}\nRec. Source]",
